# Python-learning-Projects 

This repository contains small projects I created while learning Python.  
They are simple scripts that helped me become familiar with:

- File handling  
- Exception handling  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Input/Output  
- Data structures

Each folder contains one or more scripts focused on a specific topic.
